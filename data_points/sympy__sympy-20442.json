  "problem_statement": "convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\r\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n",
  "hints_text": "Yes, this is a problem. When trying to convert into a unit that is not compatible, it should either do nothing (no conversion), or raise an exception. I personally don't see how the following makes sense:\r\n```\r\n>>> convert_to(meter, second) \r\nmeter\r\n\r\n```\nI often do calculations with units as a failsafe check. When The operation checks out and delivers reasonable units, I take it as a sign that it went well. When it \"silently\" converts an expression into non-sensible units, this cannot be used as a failsafe check.\nI am glad someone agrees this is a problem. I suggest that the physics.units package be disabled for now as it has serious flaws.\r\n\r\nMy solution is simply to use positive, real symbolic variables for units. I worry about the conversions myself. For example: `var('J m kg s Pa', positive=True, real=True)`. These behave as proper units and don't do anything mysterious. For unit conversions, I usually just use things like `.subs({J:kg*m**2/s**2})`. You could also use substitution using `.evalf()`.\n> I suggest that the physics.units package be disabled for now\r\n\r\nThat seems a little drastic.\r\n\r\nI don't use the units module but the docstring for `convert_to` says:\r\n```\r\n    Convert ``expr`` to the same expression with all of its units and quantities\r\n    represented as factors of ``target_units``, whenever the dimension is compatible.\r\n```\r\nThere are examples in the docstring showing that the `target_units` parameter can be a list and is intended to apply only to the relevant dimensions e.g.:\r\n```\r\nIn [11]: convert_to(3*meter/second, hour)                                                                                                      \r\nOut[11]: \r\n10800⋅meter\r\n───────────\r\n    hour\r\n```\r\nIf you want a function to convert between strictly between one compound unit and another or otherwise raise an error then that seems reasonable but it probably needs to be a different function (maybe there already is one).\nHi @oscarbenjamin ! Thanks for your leads and additional information provided. I am relatively new to this and have to have a deeper look at the docstring. (Actually, I had a hard time finding the right information. I was mainly using google and did not get far enough.)\nI stand by my suggestion. As my first example shows in the initial entry \nfor this issue the result from a request that should return the original \nexpression unchanged provides a wrong answer. This is exactly equivalent \nto the example you give, except that the particular case is wrong. As \n@schniepp shows there are other cases. This module needs repair and is \nnot safely usable unless you know the answer you should get.\n\nI think the convert_to function needs fixing. I would call this a bug. I \npresently do not have time to figure out how to fix it. If somebody does \nthat would be great, but if not I think leaving it active makes SymPy's \nquality control look poor.\n\nOn 9/26/20 4:07 PM, Oscar Benjamin wrote:\n> CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization.

Priority just comes down to what any contributor wants to work on.\r\n\r\nI suspect that there are really multiple separate issues here but someone needs to take the time to investigate the causes to find out.\nI agree that this is probably an indicator of multiple issues. My quick look at the code suggested there is something odd about the way the basis is handled and that I was not going to find a quick fix. Thus I went back to just treating units as symbols as I do in hand calculations. For teaching, I've concluded that is better anyway.\nI also ran into this issue and wanted  to share my experience.  I ran this command and got the following result. \r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> convert_to(5*ohm*2*A**2/cm, watt*m)\r\n1000*10**(18/19)*meter**(13/19)*watt**(13/19)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is obviously meaningless.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on.  I finally figured out the mistake was on my end.  I typed 'watt*m' for the target unit when what I wanted was 'watt/m.'  This is a problem mostly because if the user does not catch their mistake right away they are going to assume the program is not working.\n> I suggest that the physics.units package be disabled for now as it has serious flaws.\r\n\r\nIf we disable the module in the master branch, it will only become available after a new SymPy version release. At that point, we will be bombarded by millions of people complaining about the missing module on Github and Stackoverflow.\r\n\r\nApparently, `physics.units` is one of the most used modules in SymPy. We keep getting lots of complaints even for small changes.\n@Upabjojr I understand your reasoning. It still does not address the root problem of something wrong in how the basis set of units is handled. Could somebody at least update the instructions for `convert_to` to clearly warn about how it fails. \r\n\r\nI have other projects, so do not have time to contribute to the units package. Until this is fixed, I will continue to use plain vanilla positive real SymPy variables as units.\r\n\r\nRegards\nIt's curious that this conversation has taken so long, when just 5 minutes of debugging have revealed this simple error:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/702bceaa0dde32193bfa9456df89eb63153a7538/sympy/physics/units/util.py#L33\r\n\r\n`solve_least_squares` finds the solution to the matrix equation. In case no solution is found (like in `convert_to(joule*second, joule)`), it approximates to an inexact solution to the matrix system instead of raising an exception.\r\n\r\nSimply changing it to `.solve_least_squares` to `.solve` should fix this issue.",
