  "problem_statement": "diffsettings raises misleading exception message if using settings.configure()\nDescription\n\t\nIf, rather than using the env var DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE one uses settings.configure(...), attempting to call diffsettings can fail because it calls settings._setup() unconditionally, with the exception\ndjango.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested settings, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.\nwere the call instead:\nif not settings.configured:\n\tsettings._setup()\nthings would work correctly.\n",
  "hints_text": "​https://github.com/django/django/pull/9812\nKeryn I found it difficult to add a test for the patch, since I cannot find a proper way to create the environment needed to catch this case. On ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/tests/admin_scripts/tests.py#L2166, the tests use a target settings file, and if it is not present the tests will fail, so I need to configure somehow the settings, before(?) executing the actual command. Any proposal or insight? Chris",
