  "problem_statement": "Sets printing issues\nSome issues with str and srepr printing in sets. \n\nSome notes:\n- The `str` printer should always generate valid Python, which recreates the expression (but may require some variables to be defined).\n- The `srepr` printer should generate an expression that recreates the expression exactly, using only the names from `from sympy import *` (or other relevant imports for other submodules, but that isn't relevant for the sets). \n- Fancy printing should be relegated to the pretty printers (`pprint` and `latex`). \n\nHere are the issues I found:\n1. `str(Interval)`\n   \n   ```\n   In [9]: str(Interval(0, 1, False))\n   Out[9]: '[0, 1]'\n   \n   In [10]: str(Interval(0, 1, True))\n   Out[10]: '(0, 1]'\n   ```\n   \n   The former creates a list, not an interval. The latter isn't even valid Python.\n2. `srepr(S.Integers)` (and probably others)\n   \n   ```\n   In [11]: srepr(S.Integers)\n   Out[11]: 'Integers()'\n   ```\n   \n   `Integers` isn't a name that is imported from `sympy`. It should print as `S.Integers`. The `str` printers should probably do the same. \n3. `str(Union)`\n   \n   ```\n   In [18]: str(Union(S.Integers, FiniteSet(pi))) \n   Out[18]: 'Integers() U {pi}'\n   ```\n   \n   It's not valid Python. It should print as `Union(S.Integers, FiniteSet(pi))`. Printing as `Union(S.Integers, {pi})` is fine when https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/10654 gets merged. \n\nThere are likely others. I didn't check too much. An audit of the printing in the sets module would be worthwhile. \n\n",
  "hints_text": "I would like to work on this.\n\n@asmeurer  Regarding the issue 1 . I find it outputs something else on the sympy live shell . Kindly have a look . \n\n> > > str(Interval(0, 1, False))\n> > > [0,1]\n> > > \n> > > str(Interval(0, 1, True))\n> > > (0,1]\n\nAlso, \n\n> > > type(str(Interval(0, 1, False)))\n> > > <type′str′>\n> > > \n> > > type(str(Interval(0, 1, true)))\n> > > <type′str′>\n\nThe output is the same on sympy live\n\n@AnishShah  but here have a look at this screenshot of what i tried on sympy live.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10466576/13282607/cb860554-db0f-11e5-8011-2ed2702fee66.png)\n\nIf I am going wrong somewhere then kindly guide.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm missing something, but the output in your screenshot is same as the output mentioned by @asmeurer. I don't see any difference.\n\n'[0, 1]' and [0, 1] . I think it is already a string after getting evaluated by str.\n\n@SalilVishnuKapur that's because the SymPy Live shell renders the output as LaTeX. \n\nYou should work locally against the git master. SymPy Live has some differences against the normal SymPy which might confuse, but more importantly, it runs SymPy 0.7.6, whereas you want to work against the git master. \n\nI would like to take this up. :)\n\nI also want to work on this but i am new here so  how should start?\n\nIt looks like this has already been started at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10708, so you should at least wait until that is merged and see if anything is left to do then. \n\nAlso see https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Development-workflow for general instructions on how to contribute. \n\nOhkk thanks Aaron Meurer!!!  I will wait for that or I will work on other Issue. Thanks for suggestion.\n\nRelated https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/10035\n\n@asmeurer \r\nPlease review PR #12112 \nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/12213\n@Upabjojr wrong number? I don't see how that's related. \n> wrong number? I don't see how that's related.\r\n\r\nSorry, I wanted to link the issue of the `And` and `Or` str() printer.\nPlease review #12112 \n@Upabjojr I don't think this issue should be closed. #12112 takes care of only `str` printer. `srepr` printer is still the same.\n@SagarB-97 github apparently closed the issue automatically, I didn't actually notice that.",
