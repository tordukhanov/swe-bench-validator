On a new postgresql-based project: create a new app 'foo' with the following models.py from django.db import models class Bar(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=255) class Meta: unique_together = (('id',),) ./manage.py makemigrations ./manage.py migrate comment out the 'class Meta' ./manage.py makemigrations ./manage.py migrate This is not specific to the primary key field - it happens more generally on single-field unique_together constraints that duplicate a unique=True constraint, such as: class Bar(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True) class Meta: unique_together = (('name'),)\nCan't see a good way of fixing this without breaking backwards compatibility. The alter_unique_together logic in db/backends/schema.py relies on the UNIQUE constraints generated by unique_together to be distinguishable within the database from constraints generated through other mechanisms (e.g. unique=True) - but this isn't possible when the unique_together rule only contains a single field. Another way this manifests itself is to perform the following steps, in separate migrations: create a model add unique=True to one if its fields add a unique_together constraint for that same field This results in two identical calls to _create_unique_sql, leading to a 'relation \"foo_bar_name_1e64ed8ec8cfa1c7_uniq\" already exists' error.\nReplying to matthewwestcott: Can't see a good way of fixing this without breaking backwards compatibility. The alter_unique_together logic in db/backends/schema.py relies on the UNIQUE constraints generated by unique_together to be distinguishable within the database from constraints generated through other mechanisms (e.g. unique=True) - but this isn't possible when the unique_together rule only contains a single field. I have encountered this same issue. Could you explain the backwards compatibility issue here? It seems to me that the bug is in attempting to drop or create an index when that is not called for, either because the index is required by a different constraint or was already created by another constraint. Is that behavior that needs to be kept.\nJust got hit by this bug, I believe that at least in recent versions of Django (at least 3.2.13) it is now possible to distinguish unique=True constraints from unique_together ones. At least in the application I'm working on, there seem to be two different naming schemes: For UNIQUE CONSTRAINT created with unique=True the naming scheme seems to be <table_name>_<field_name>_key For UNIQUE CONSTRAINT created with unique_together the naming scheme seems to be <table_name>_<field_names>_<hash>_uniq Note that this is extrapolated from me looking at my application's database schemas, I haven't read the code so I am unsure if this is in fact what happens all of the time. So in the case where we would want to delete a unique_together constraint that had a single field, we'd just look for foo_bar_%_uniq and drop that constraint, here is an SQL statement (in PostgreSQL) that I used in a manual migration (originally from â€‹https://stackoverflow.com/a/12396684) in case it can be useful to someone that comes across this bug again: DO $body$ DECLARE _con text := ( SELECT quote_ident(conname) FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'my_table'::regclass AND contype = 'u' AND conname LIKE 'my_table_my_field_%_uniq' ); BEGIN EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE my_table DROP CONSTRAINT ' || _con; END $body$; So I think it's possible to fix this bug now?\nAs a workaround, it may be possible to migrate the unique_together to a UniqueConstraint, keeping the same index name, and then dropping the UniqueConstraint. Just an idea, untested.\nHey there, It's indeed still (mostly) relevant. I've tried to tackle the issue, here is a first draft of the â€‹PR. \"Mostly\" because I couldn't reproduce the part that Matt is describing about adding a unique_together: Another way this manifests itself is to perform the following steps, in separate migrations: create a model add unique=True to one if its fields add a unique_together constraint for that same field This results in two identical calls to _create_unique_sql, leading to a 'relation \"foo_bar_name_1e64ed8ec8cfa1c7_uniq\" already exists' error. For the rest, removing the unique_together on a PK field and on a unique=True field should work now, when we base the constraint checking on how the unique_together names are generated by default. However, this will break dropping such a constraint if it has been renamed manually. I think this should be fine, as the name is generated by Django and never really exposed - so I guess it's okay to regard this name as internals of Django, and we can rely on it. Feel free to tell me what you think of the PR :)",
