  "problem_statement": "Where oo belongs? (Concept)\nHi again, well, i'm little confuse of the conditions to take or not `oo` in some sets:\n\n``` python\n>>> Interval(-oo, oo)\n(-oo, oo)\n```\n\nFirst the means the interval is created excluding `oo` and `-oo`, and interval interpret it in that way, but now:\n\n``` python\n>>> Interval(oo, oo)\n{oo}\n```\n\nHere is a little conflict, in first place Interval show don't take `oo` but now it is there? in some way is fine to have a way to can represent the `oo` from Interval.\n\nNow from this point we have some points:\nHow they will interpret the limit concept? basically two options, limit is:\n\n``` python\n[x, oo]\n```\n\nor\n\n``` python\n[x, oo)\n```\n\n?\nThis point is very important, because define the behavior for sets, and affects directly like this issue: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11174\n\nso, for now only to match the math in all sets we can say the limit is calculated via\n\n``` python\n[x, oo)\n```\n\nnow, what is the effect of this in Sympy?, first this enable the limit concept in every unbounded set, for now i found this two issues:\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11688\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11640\n\nfor example, actually we have this:\n\n``` python\n>>> solveset(y/x, x)\nEmptySet()\n```\n\nthis return should be something like... `nan`? because in the limit we don't know what is the proportion of `y` and `x`, so we can't calc it.\n\nactually this concept is applied in some way like:\n\n``` python\n>>> solveset(y*x, x)\n{0} \n```\n\nNow the next question, `oo` will represent the infinite, as a integer, real or what?\ni know this question don't have sense, but let me try explain it:\n\n``` python\n>>> Interval(-oo, oo) in S.Reals\nFalse\n>>> Interval(-oo, oo) in S.Naturals\n#can't be calculated for now\n```\n\nif the oo represent the infinite without form, it can exist in S.Naturals, and S.Reals, but if you represent the infinite like the interval between it, `Interval(x, oo)` where is the limit of x to infinite while always `x < oo`, in other way `Interval(A, B)` where A go to `oo` and B do to `oo`, but it need always will respect this condition `A < B` so between `A` and `B` can exist any type of numbers, so `oo` can't exist in `S.Naturals` because `Interval(A, B)` can contains a real number for example, but the extension of that concept says `oo` can't exist in any set, because always will exist a bigger set, in sympy you have an approximation of it, is `UniversalSet`, but don't will be true completely, because, why is it the limit set?, `UniversalSet` can represent two things, the limit of the actually human knowledge (or applied to Sympy), or the 'master' set, thinking its like the perfection of the sets knowledge.\nObvs, to `oo` make some sense in the actual system the option is interpret `oo` without limit or form, and take the second interpretation of `UniversalSet` (if you take the first. `oo` can't exist in any place).\nIf you disagree you always can discuss and change the behavior.\n\nObjetives of this issue:\n\nGet a clear definitions in Sympy of:\n- Infinite\n- Limit\n- UniversalSet\n\nThen, clear the behavior of this concepts in Sympy, and to finish, set the behavior in Sympy.\n\nThx. Cya.\n\n",
  "hints_text": "Interval should represent a real interval. I think we decided in another issue that Interval should always be open for infinite boundaries, because it should always be a subset of S.Reals. So \n\n```\n>>> Interval(oo, oo)\n{oo}\n```\n\nis wrong.  I'm going to modify the issue title to make this clearer. \n\nRegarding your other points, note that `in` means \"is contained in\", not \"is subset of\". So `<set of numbers> in <set of numbers>` will always give False. I'm really not following your other points, but note that both `S.Reals` and `S.Naturals` (the latter is a subset of the former) contain only _finite_ numbers, so `oo` is not contained in either). \n",
