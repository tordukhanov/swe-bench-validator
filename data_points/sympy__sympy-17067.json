I get the same result on version 1.4 on my own computer, and was getting this result from 1.3 before I updated today.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Note that Ethan reduced this to a much simpler expression below, so that's obviously a better MWE.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I haven't been able to cut it down to smaller size and still get an error; I have tried.  The MWE is this:\r\n```python\r\nalpha, beta, gamma = symbols('alpha beta gamma')\r\nexpr = (-sin(beta/2)*sin(alpha/2 - gamma/2)*sin(alpha/2 + gamma/2)/(2*cos(beta/2)*cos(alpha/2 + gamma/2)**2) + sin(beta/2)*cos(alpha/2 - gamma/2)/(2*cos(beta/2)*cos(alpha/2 + gamma/2)))/(sin(alpha/2 + gamma/2)**2/cos(alpha/2 + gamma/2)**2 + 1) + (sin(alpha/2 - gamma/2)*sin(alpha/2 + gamma/2)*cos(beta/2)/(2*sin(beta/2)*cos(alpha/2 - gamma/2)**2) - cos(beta/2)*cos(alpha/2 + gamma/2)/(2*sin(beta/2)*cos(alpha/2 - gamma/2)))/(sin(alpha/2 - gamma/2)**2/cos(alpha/2 - gamma/2)**2 + 1)\r\nsimplify(expr)\r\n```\r\nThe output is\r\n```python\r\n-2*cos(alpha)*cos(beta)/sin(2*beta)\r\n```\r\n[which could be further simplified to `-cos(alpha)*csc(beta)`].  It should be\r\n```python\r\n-cos(alpha)*cot(beta)\r\n```\r\nas verified by Mathematica (directly using the output of `print(mathematica_code(expr))`), and by direct calculation using trig identities.  This isn't just a matter of `simplify` refusing to do something that may not always be true; this is really the wrong result.\r\n\r\nThe expression looks big and ugly, but is actually pretty simple when you stare at it for a minute:\r\n<img width=\"802\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-20 at 2 11 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1470769/59871428-91497080-9365-11e9-8f1b-b586d53bf7d3.png\">\r\n\r\nThose denominators can be simplified immediately to `1/cos**2` of the respective arguments.  Then you just cancel, group terms, and apply standard trig identities, and get the correct result.  Sympy will actually correctly simplify each fraction individually, but then it refuses to further simplify the sum — but at least that sum would be correct, unlike what it does with this whole expression.  (Of course, this happened in the middle of a much longer calculation, so I didn't know it was going wrong, and have spent the past few days wondering why I was getting inconsistent results when using this wrong answer.)\n",
  "hints_text": "I was able to reduce your problem expression to `(cos(a - b) + cos(a + b))/(sin(b/2)*cos(b/2))`, which SymPy incorrectly simplifies to `8*cos(a)*cos(b)/sin(2*b)`.\nThanks @ethankward!  That's true even though it correctly simplifies the numerator and denominator separately, and then correctly simplifies that ratio.  It gets the same wrong answer with the equivalent expression `(2*cos(a)*cos(b))/(sin(b/2)*cos(b/2))`, but actually gets the right answer with the inequivalent expression `(cos(a - b) + cos(a + b))/(sin(b)*cos(b))`.\nSpecifically something goes wrong in `simplify.fu.TRmorrie`.",
