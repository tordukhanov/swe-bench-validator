  "problem_statement": "Add a way to defer loading of MathJax\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIt is quite tricky to configure MathJax to work with Sphinx currently.\r\n\r\nSphinx loads MathJax asynchronously since https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3606 and https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/5005.  While this was fine for MathJax 2, because of the special kind of ``<script>`` blocks mentioned in https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/5616 , it doesn't work well with MathJax 3.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in MathJax 3, MathJax expect a config `<script>` block to be present *before* MathJax is loaded. Sphinx 4 added `mathjax3_config` parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if app.config.mathjax3_config:\r\n            body = 'window.MathJax = %s' % json.dumps(app.config.mathjax3_config)\r\n            app.add_js_file(None, body=body)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis assumes that the `config` is a simple dictionary, which isn't sufficient: that configuration should be able to contain functions, for example.\r\n\r\nThe only possibility at the moment is to add a separate script file containing a MathJax configuration and to load it with ``app.add_js_file``.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThere are three possibilities:\r\n\r\n- Allow arbitrary strings for mathjax3_config, and in that case don't JSON-serialize them.\r\n- Change `async` to `defer` when loading MathJax.\r\n- Make it possible for users to change `async` to `defer` themselves.  At the moment this isn't possible because the `async` flags is unconditionally added:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n      if app.registry.html_assets_policy == 'always' or domain.has_equations(pagename):\r\n        # Enable mathjax only if equations exists\r\n        options = {'async': 'async'}\r\n        if app.config.mathjax_options:\r\n            options.update(app.config.mathjax_options)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThe latter two are preferable because they would allow individual pages to use different MathJax config by using a `.. raw::` block to override the default MathJax configuration on a given page (the script in that ``raw`` block will run before MathJax loads thanks to the `defer` option).\r\n\r\nCC @jfbu , the author of #5616.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\n",
  "hints_text": "I'm not good at loading JS. Could you let me know the impact of changing `async` to `defer`? Are there any incompatible change for users? If not, we can change the loading option for MathJax to `defer` in the next version.\nI don't think it's an incompatible change.  For MDN:\r\n\r\n> - If the async attribute is present, then the script will be executed asynchronously as soon as it downloads.\r\n> - If the async attribute is absent but the defer attribute is present, then the script is executed when the page has finished parsing.\r\n\r\nSo changing `async` to `defer` just rules out certain behaviors (the script starts executing before the whole page is parsed), it shouldn't add any new ones.\r\n\nI found an explanation for this topic:\r\n\r\n>Note that here we use the defer attribute on both scripts so that they will execute in order, but still not block the rest of the page while the files are being downloaded to the browser. If the async attribute were used, there is no guarantee that the configuration would run first, and so you could get instances where MathJax doesnâ€™t get properly configured, and they would seem to occur randomly.\r\n>https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html#using-a-local-file-for-configuration\r\n\r\nI believe using defer option instead is a good alternative.",
