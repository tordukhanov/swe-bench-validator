  "hints_text": "@wakita\r\nshouldn't these be 1\r\nI would like to work on this issue\r\n```\r\n>>> Sum(e[0,i],(i,0,n-1)).doit()\r\n0\r\n>>> Sum(e[i,0],(i,0,n-1)).doit()\r\n0\r\n```\nHey,\r\nI would like to try to solve this issue. Where should I look first?\r\nInteresting observation if I replace j with i in e[i, j] the answer comes as n**2 which is correct.. \n@Vedarth would you give your code here\n@SatyaPrakashDwibedi `print(Sum(Sum(e[i, i], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())`\r\nHere is something more... \r\nif i write `print Sum(e[i,i] ,(i ,0 ,n-1) ,(j ,0 ,n-1)).doit()` it gives the same output.\r\nI am not sure where to look to fix the issue ,though, please tell me if you get any leads.\n@SatyaPrakashDwibedi Yes, both of the two math expressions that you gave should be 1s.\r\n\r\n@Vedarth n**2 is incorrect.  'e' is an identity matrix.  The total sum should be the same as the number of diagonal elements, which is 'n'.\nThe problem appears to be that while `e[0,0] == e[j,j] == 1`, `e[I,j] == 0` -- it assumes that if the indices are different then you are off-diagonal rather than not evaluating them at all because it is not known if `i == j`. I would start by looking in an `eval` method for this object. Inequality of indices *only for Numbers* should give 0 (while equality of numbers or expressions should give 1).\n@smichr I see.  Thank you for your enlightenment.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this situation be similar to `KroneckerDelta(i, j)`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ni, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\nn = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\nSum(Sum(KroneckerDelta(i, j), (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()\r\n```\r\ngives the following answer:\r\n\r\n`Sum(Piecewise((1, And(0 <= j, j <= n - 1)), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))`\r\n\r\nIf SymPy can reduce this formula to `n`, I suppose reduction of `e[i, j]` to a KroneckerDelta is a candidate solution.\n@smichr I would like to work on this issue.\r\nWhere should I start looking\r\nand have a look \r\n```\r\n>>> Sum(e[k, 0], (i, 0, n-1))\r\nSum(0, (i, 0, n - 1))\r\n```\r\nwhy??\n@smichr You are right. It is ignoring i==j case. What do you mean by eval method? Please elaborate a little bit on how do you want it done. I am trying to solve it.\r\n@wakita I think you already know it by now but I am just clarifying anyways, e[i,i] in my code will be evaluated as sum of diagonals n times which gives `n*n` or `n**2.` So it is evaluating it correctly.\r\n@SatyaPrakashDwibedi I have already started working on this issue. If you find anything useful please do inform me. It would be a great help. More the merrier :)\r\n@SatyaPrakashDwibedi The thing is it is somehow omitting the case where (in e[firstelement, secondelement]) the first element == second element. That is why even though when we write [k,0] it is giving 0. I have tried several other combinations and this result is consistent.\r\nHow ever if we write `print(Sum(Sum(e[0, 0], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())` output is `n**2` as it is evaluating adding e[0,0] `n*n` times.\r\n\n> I wonder if this situation be similar to KroneckerDelta(i, j)\r\n\r\nExactly. Notice how the KD is evaluated as a `Piecewise` since we don't know whether `i==j` until actual values are substituted.\r\n\r\nBTW, you don't have to write two `Sum`s; you can have a nested range:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> Sum(i*j,(i,1,3),(j,1,3)).doit()  # instead of Sum(Sum(i*j, (i,1,3)), (j,1,3)).doit()\r\n36\r\n>>> sum([i*j for i in range(1,4) for j in range(1,4)])\r\n36\r\n```\nOK, it's the `_entry` method of the `Identity` that is the culprit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def _entry(self, i, j):\r\n        if i == j:\r\n            return S.One\r\n        else:\r\n            return S.Zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should just return `KroneckerDelta(i, j)`. When it does then\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> print(Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, (0 <= j) & (j <= n - 1)), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> t=_\r\n>>> t.subs(n,3)\r\n3\r\n>>> t.subs(n,30)\r\n30\r\n```\r\n\r\nbreadcrumb: tracing is a great way to find where such problems are located. I started a trace with the expression `e[1,2]` and followed the trace until I saw where the 0 was being returned: in the `_entry` method.\n@smichr I guess,it is fixed then.Nothing else to be done?\n```\r\n>>> Sum(KroneckerDelta(i, j), (i, 0, n-1), (j, 0, n-1)).doit()\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, j <= n - 1), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think, given that (j, 0, n-1), we can safely say that `j <= n - 1` always holds.  Under this condition, the Piecewise form can be reduced to `1` and we can have `n` for the symbolic result.  Or am I demanding too much?\n@smichr so we need to return KroneckerDelta(i,j) instead of S.one and S.zero? Is that what you mean?\n> so we need to return KroneckerDelta(i,j) instead of S.one and S.zero\r\n\r\nAlthough that would work, it's probably overkill. How about returning:\r\n\r\n```\r\neq = Eq(i, j)\r\nif eq == True:\r\n    return S.One\r\nelif eq == False:\r\n    return S.Zero\r\nreturn Piecewise((1, eq), (0, True)) # this line alone is sufficient; maybe it's better to avoid Piecewise\r\n```\n@smichr I made one PR [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12316),I added Kronecker delta,it passes the tests, could you please review it.\n@smichr  First of all I am so sorry for extremely late response. Secondly, I don't think def _entry is the culprit. _entry's job is to tell if e[i,j] is 0 or 1 depending on the values and i think it is doing it's job just fine. But the problem is that when we write e[i,j] it automatically assumes i and j are different and ignores the cases where they are ,in fact, same. I tried \r\n\r\n> '''eq = Eq(i, j)\r\nif eq == True:\r\n    return S.One\r\nelif eq == False:\r\n    return S.Zero\r\nreturn Piecewise((1, eq), (0, True)) # this line alone is sufficient; maybe it's better to avoid Piecewise'''\r\n\r\nBut it did not work. Answer is still coming as 0.\r\nAlso i fiddled around a bit and noticed some thing interesting\r\n```\r\nfor i in range(0,5):\r\n    for j in range(0,5):\r\n        print e[i,j] # e is identity matrix.\r\n```\r\nthis gives the correct output. All the ones and zeroes are there. Also,\r\n```\r\nx=0\r\nfor i in range(0,5):\r\n    for j in range(0,5):\r\n        x=x+e[i,j]\r\nprint x\r\n```\r\nAnd again it is giving a correct answer. So i think it is a problem somewhere else may be an eval error.\r\nI don't know how to solve it please explain how to do it. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\n> fiddled around a bit and noticed some thing interesting\r\n\r\nThat's because you are using literal values for `i` and `j`: `Eq(i,j)` when `i=1`, `j=2` gives `S.false`.\r\n\r\nThe modifications that I suggested work only if you don't nest the Sums; I'm not sure why the Sums don't denest when Piecewise is involved but (as @wakita demonstrated) it *is* smart enough when using KroneckerDelta to denest, but it doesn't evaluate until a concrete value is substituted.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from sympy import Q as Query\r\n>>>\r\n>>> n = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\n>>> i, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\n>>> M = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)\r\n>>>\r\n>>> e = None\r\n>>> with assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):\r\n...     e = refine((M.T * M).doit())\r\n...\r\n>>> g = Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1), (j, 0, n-1))\r\n>>> g.subs(n,3)\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, Eq(i, j)), (0, True)), (i, 0, 2), (j, 0, 2))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\n3\r\n\r\n# the double sum form doesn't work\r\n\r\n>>> Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1))\r\nSum(Piecewise((Sum(1, (i, 0, n - 1)), Eq(i, j)), (Sum(0, (i, 0, n - 1)), True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> _.subs(n,3)\r\nSum(Piecewise((Sum(1, (i, 0, 2)), Eq(i, j)), (Sum(0, (i, 0, 2)), True)), (j, 0, 2))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\nPiecewise((3, Eq(i, 0)), (0, True)) + Piecewise((3, Eq(i, 1)), (0, True)) + Piecewise((3, Eq(i, 2)), (0, True))\r\n\r\n# the KroneckerDelta form denests but doesn't evaluate until you substitute a concrete value\r\n\r\n>>> Sum(Sum(KroneckerDelta(i,j), (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1))\r\nSum(KroneckerDelta(i, j), (i, 0, n - 1), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, (0 <= j) & (j <= n - 1)), (0, True)), (j, 0, n - 1))\r\n>>> _.subs(n,3)\r\nSum(Piecewise((1, (0 <= j) & (j <= 2)), (0, True)), (j, 0, 2))\r\n>>> _.doit()\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the better behavior of KroneckerDelta, perhaps the `_entry` should be written in terms of that instead of Piecewise.",
