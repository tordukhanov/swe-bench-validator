  "problem_statement": "Improve program name for Django's command-line utility.\nDescription\n\t\nBy default, according to the â€‹documentation there are three ways to execute Django's command-line utility:\n$ django-admin <command> [options]\n$ manage.py <command> [options]\n$ python -m django <command> [options]\nWhen executing the help command, however, the way these are rendered may be incorrect:\n$ django-admin help\nType 'django-admin help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.\n...\n$ ./manage.py help\nType 'manage.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.\n...\n$ python -m django help\nType '__main__.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.\n...\nIt should also be noted that manage.py will typically not work and ./manage.py is required:\n$ manage.py help\nbash: manage.py: command not found\nOn Windows it will work, but only if the file type is associated with the Python interpreter and not an editor.\nSo, the issues here are:\n__main__.py should be replaced by python -m django (or possibly use os.path.basename(sys.executable))\nShould manage.py be replaced with ./manage.py on non-Windows platforms? What about Windows?\nWhat should happen with the manage.py option in the documentation?\n",
