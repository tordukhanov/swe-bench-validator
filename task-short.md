**Assignment Type**: Infrastructure Development Test  
**Target Role**: Agent Infrastructure Developers

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **[SWE-bench](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench)** evaluation library  
- **Docker**
- **GitHub Actions**
- **LLM coding tools** (Cursor, Roo Code, Claude Code)

## What You'll Build

- **Create a validator** using SWE-bench's official evaluation harness to verify golden patches work correctly
- **Build a GitHub Action** that validates only changed data points in pull requests
